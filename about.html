    <h1>Wesley Robertson</h1>
    <p class="about">Since high school, I have developed a love for graphic and UI design. Since then, I have been able to develop a deeper understanding for the field and learn many relevant skills such as HTML, React, and Python. I have used these various skills to challenge myself to various projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am currently in a double degree program studying both Business at Wilfrid Laurier University and Mathematics at University of Waterloo. My previous work experiences includes a Staff Accuntant position at Bateman Mackay, backshop attendant at Brantford golf and Country Club, cook at ancaster mill, and finally, co-op graphic designer at DesignWerx. All of these experiences have taught me relevant skills in order to be a excellent leader and team player in the workplace. 
        <br>
        <br>
        When not coding and working on various projects, you will probably find me golfing, making music, cooking, or grinding a difficult math problem. I also love to travel and explore different cultures.
