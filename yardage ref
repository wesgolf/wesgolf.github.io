    <p class="product">Product</p>
    <p class="product2">The goal for this product was to provide the members of Hamilton Golf and Country Club a yardage book to give precice yardages from any point on any hole and give a detailed topography map for each green to assist users in reading greens and seeing how greens will react to approach shots. The overaching goal with the design was to add as much information to assist the user while keeping a simple and minimalist design as possible.</p>

    <p class="cont">Context</p>
    <p class="cont1"> The reason why I went about making this is because Hamilton Golf and Country Club does not currently have a yardage book. Without a rangefinder, some golfers (including me) do not have a rangefinder, and thus is not able to get accuate yardages. This will allow users to get a yardage to the pin as well as povide a detailed view of the hole as well as the green topography.</p>



    <h3 class="dp">Design Process</h3>
    <p class="res">Research</p>
    <p class="res1">The first step that I took to this project is conduct research in order to see what the average user of a yardage book wants. The next step from there was to research what are the features in a yardage book and see what the typical yardage book includes. From there, I was able to create a few rough sketches and share it with some industry professionals to get their opinion on how I could improve my design.</p>

    <p class="ide">Idea and Design</p>
    <p class="ide1"> After gathering feedback from industry professionals, I then came up with my final sketches. From there, my next step was to hop into illustrator and photoshop to create a good copy of the actual product.</p>

    <p class="rev">Revise</p>
    <p class="rev1"> Next, I shared my good copy with my industry professionals to get further feedback. From there, I was able to  </p>

    <p class="pre">Finish</p>
    <p class="pre1">After inplimenting all of my groups ideas, I was able to finish my full prototype. From there, I used native tools within Adobe XD to incorporate it into our overall pitch.</p>

    <div class="design">
        <p class="tit">Design</p>
        <p class="desc"> As the objective of this app was a mental health app, the goal was to make the users feel welcome. Thus, I decided that the primary colour for this app UI would be blue, as it is the most welcoming and calm colour. From there, our group wanted to stess what the purpose of the app was, thus, we went with the message icon as our logo with the + in the middle to give the logo a little more of a customized feel. Lastly, for the fonts, I ended up choosing _____ since this potrayed the calm feeling of the app.</p>
