    <p class="product">Product</p>
    <p class="product2">Connect+ was designed to be the link between people stugging with mental health to others struggling with mental health as well as therapists. The app offers various ways to connect with one another, for example, texting, video calls, and discussion board. The goal for this was to add as many features for someone strugglng with mental health as possible to help them, with keeping a simple and minimalistic design. The idea for this product came after our group saw the effect of COVID-19 on mental health, and its difficulty it poses to connect with others.</p>

    <p class="cont">Context</p>
    <p class="cont1">For a semester long business pitch project, our groups idea was to create an app. However, in order to give this app a competitive advantage, I decided to create a working prototype of our app idea. Although we didn't end up winning, I was still able to learn a lot about the design process and working for a team.</p>



    <h3 class="dp">Design Process</h3>
    <p class="res">Research</p>
    <p class="res1">Initally, when coming up with this idea, I talked to my group members to see what features could give this app a competitive advantage in the app store. From there, I researched what made a good app in terms of UX and sketched a primary idea. From there, I was able to share with my group what I found and my ideas going forward in the project. I was able to incorporate their feeback and make revisions to my sketches before starting on using CAD to design my project.</p>

    <p class="ide">Idea and Design</p>
    <p class="ide1"> The next step is to of course design the user interface of the app. Iniatlly, I opened up Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to construct a rough idea. From there, I was able to use what I made and make a full user interface in Adobe XD.</p>

    <p class="rev">Revies</p>
    <p class="rev1"> After finalizing the first version of the full interface in Adobe XD, I showed ths to my group. From there, I was able to explain what I have created and sought feedback from my group in order to improve the app and more truely reflect what our pitch was all about.</p>

    <p class="pre">Present</p>
    <p class="pre1">After inplimenting all of my groups ideas, I was able to finish my full prototype. From there, I used native tools within Adobe XD to incorporate it into our overall pitch.</p>

    <div class="design">
        <p class="tit">Design</p>
        <p class="desc"> As the objective of this app was a mental health app, the goal was to make the users feel welcome. Thus, I decided that the primary colour for this app UI would be blue, as it is the most welcoming and calm colour. From there, our group wanted to stess what the purpose of the app was, thus, we went with the message icon as our logo with the + in the middle to give the logo a little more of a customized feel. Lastly, for the fonts, I ended up choosing _____ since this potrayed the calm feeling of the app.</p>

    <h3 class="hfd">High-Fidelity Design</h3>
    <div class="splash">
        <h1> Splash Screen </h1>
        <h6>The splash screen design is relatively simple. The main goal for this screen is to welcome the users of the app. The reason that we went with the blue colour is to make the users feel welcome, as blue is a welcoming colour. </h6>
    </div>
    <div class="signup">
        <h1 class="right">Login/Signup Screen</h1>
        <h6 class="right">The goal of the signup/login screen was to make the experience for the user to make an account/login to be as seamless as possible. One way that this is implimented is with the various ways that you can login/signup into the app.</h6>
    </div>
    <div class="homescreen">
        <h1>Home Screen</h1>
        <h6>The design of the home page was intended to make the user access the various features of the app as quickly as possible. The background images add context to each of the images in case it was not clear enough.</h6>
    </div>
    <div class="settings">
        <h1 class="right">Settings</h1>
        <h6 class="right">The Settings page was intended to help the user change the app in order to make the experience as personal as possible. Thus, there are multiple features that can be changed in order to achieve this.</h6>
